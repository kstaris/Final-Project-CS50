# True car price calculator
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
  This is a calculator that gives you a simple way to calculate the true cost of car ownership. Usually we think of just the inital price (or leasing) and fuel price when we think about it. But there are a few more expenses to consider. It is especially interesiting if you are considering to buy a new or used car and are wondering if it makes sense for you to switch to an electric vehicle. After looking online I realsied that there are calculators that give you the oportunity to calcule the true car ownership price, but they miss some of the parameters I find important or do not allow to save and compare cars.
##### Index:
  On the first page I have made a form that you have to fill to find out the price. The car manufacturer, models and years are provided from a database. These are necessary to fill only if you wish to save your query. If you don't know what to input for some of these parameters, you can opt to have it filled with average values and then adjust them to your preferences. The monthly price changes dinamically on each value change so it is easier for you to see what matters more. If you have logged in, you can also save your results in database and go to "Saved searches".
##### Saved searches:
  In saved queries page you can see all the cars that you have saved. From here you can edit or delete any of the cars. If you wan to compare cars you can do so for up to 3 cars. You must check the cars that you want to compare and click the "Compare" button. A table will be generated that displays all the selected car parameters.
##### Edit:
  Edit page looks very similar to index page, but here you have an "edit" instead of "save" button. Once you click it the values for the chosen car are updated.
##### Log in and register:
  For log-in and register pages I decided to reuse code that was provided for the "finance" problemset since I did not need any extra functionality.
